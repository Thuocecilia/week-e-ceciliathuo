## üí° About the Project

This portfolio serves as a digital representation of my work and who I am. It's more than just a list of accomplishments; it‚Äôs a narrative of my journey, blending my academic discipline in civil engineering with my creative interests. The design is intentionally clean and intuitive, ensuring a seamless experience for visitors.

The site is a testament to my skills in **front-end development**, specifically using **HTML5** for structure and **CSS3** for styling and animations. I‚Äôve implemented a user-friendly interface that allows for quick navigation through different sections without leaving the page.
